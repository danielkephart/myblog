# Welcome
<p>Hi, my name is <b>Daniel Kephart</b>. I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the <b>University of Rochester</b> in New York. I study the influence of <i>fashion</i> during the European Middle Ages, as well as literary form more generally.</p>
<p>I built this website to serve as a homebase for those interested in my work. Here, you can find my blog as well as a list of things I'm currently working on.</p>
